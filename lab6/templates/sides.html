{% block recipename1 %} Moros y Cristianos (Black Beans and Rice) {% endblock %}
<!-- recipe information -->
{% block info %} This recipe is a delicious mix of black beans and rice. The rice absorbs the taste
and color of the beans. This dish actually has a deep, cultural history. The dish is said to have 
originated during the Moor's invasion of Spain, and later brought to Cuba via Spanish invaders. 
I usually just call the dish black beans and rice, or congris (with grey).
